Today was the day. The day I got to meet and hug Kelly Clarkson!  This woman has been someone I have admired since I first heard her sing on idol, but I truly connected with her when she sang "Think Twice" by Celine Dion in the semifinals of American Idol.  The song got medeiocre reviews from the judges, but they all agreed (me included) that Kelly killed it! The song, Think Twice, was from the album The Colour of My Love from 1993 and was one of my all time favorite albums.  It immediately took me back to listening and belting out this album on repeat as a child. I continued to love Kelly's music and at one point I even had her song "Never Again" as my alarm, but I could never seem to afford to go to any of her concerts.  The closest I came was when I was a server and she sang at the Allegan County Fair.  Tickets were $60 a piece and as much as I wanted to go, living paycheck to paycheck, it just didn't seem worth it. Cut to Valentine's Day 2019, my friend got tickets to Kelly's Meaning of Life tour through vet tics and invited me along. Not only did we get super cheap tickets, they ended up being **ON THE FLOOR**. I was literally standing less than 50 feet from Kelly Clarkson. It was one of the most amazing experiences and I even snapped a few cool pics, including one where she had accidentaly broken her mic pack by jumping to "Since U Been Gone".

After the concert, it really invigorated my love for her again and I started watching absolutely everything she did.  All of the "Minute and a Glass of Wine" segments on YouTube, the BBA's, any little interview I could find.  And then, I got the best news. Kelly Clarkson was getting a talk show. It was like life said, "Here, have your daily dose of a good cry and then laugh your ass off in less than one hour 5 days a week!"

 I instantly loved it, not only did she seem to be the most genuine person herself, but she shines a spotlight on others who are amazing people as well. I decided pretty early on that I was going to try and do everything in my power to get on that show. I sent in all the requests I could think of on the shows website and even received a call back from a producer at one point. In talks with the producer, I was told if I could get tickets to the show, then there was a possibility I could do the "Kellyoke" song request. I started looking at dates and applying for as many shows as I could within my time constraints. Since The Voice was on as well, I thought I should try to get both shows in one trip. I mean why not right? It turns out applying for tickets to these shows is an agonizing waiting process and especially flying in from Michigan everything had to be done last minute.  I ended up getting "priority" tickets to The Voice on 11/12 and "priority" tickets to The Kelly Clarkson Show on 11/14.  Priority meant that I was guaranteed entry, so I knew this was my chance. I called up my friend, who had no prior knowledge I was doing this, and said "Hey, want to go to California with me to see The Voice and The Kelly Clarkson Show?" She said YES! We booked our flights and hotels with only 4 days left to wait until our trip.

 Our first flight had an overnight layover, so we got a hotel in Denver and headed back the next morning to our flight that would land us in L.A. just over 3 hours before we had to be at The Voice for our taping. We got our seats and found out we were seperated on this flight, but figured it would be fine. We board the plane and we are a few rows apart, seperated by a huge family flying back home from a funeral. One of the dads offered me the aisle seat, so he could help with the kids. I accepted and started telling him I had 3 kids of my own and totally understand what they are going through. I showed him pictures of my kids and chatted about why they were flying. He then asked me what we were doing in L.A., and I said going to see The Voice and The Kelly Clarkson Show. He chuckled and said no kidding, my buddy works on both of those shows! He asked for my name and proceeded to text his friend, you will never guess who this "friend" turned out to be!
