  <p>
    I am a mom of 3 wonderful children and I have still managed to find the time
    to teach myself to code. I love developing web sites that are beautiful,
    fluid, and responsive. I thrive on mobile-first development with an
    extensive knowledge of CSS and React with Gatsby, Svelte with Sapper, SEO,
    UX/UI design, and logo design. I love learning about all the cool new stuff
    that comes out in the tech world daily. I also ðŸ’“ coffee and beer, well
    because mom life!
